Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Ada. Her family was 
so poor that all their savings fit inside a cookie jar. They didn’t have 
enough money to live in a proper home. Instead, Ada lived with her 
mother and her little brother, Alan, in a cabin near a junkyard on the edge of town.

** 5 **

Far away, at the other end of town, lived a famous inventor named Zangemann. 
He was immensely rich. No sheet of paper in the world was big enough to 
show his bank balance with all its numbers and zeros! He lived in a huge 
house with a swimming pool and waterslide, lots of staircases and towers, 
hundreds of windows, and so many rooms that he often got lost in them 
himself. Zangemann’s mansion stood high on a hill. From there, he could 
look out over the whole city.

## 6 ##

Computers had fascinated Zangemann ever since he was a child. 
When he was young, computers were huge machines with lots 
of cables and loud, noisy fans. At school, little Zangemann often 
dreamed of all the things he would do with computers if they were just a little 
bit smaller — small enough that they could be built into other fun things. He 
knew what he would do. First, he would build a computer into his skateboard 
so that it would make cool noises when he rode it — maybe a fire engine siren 
or the sound of a rocket launch. Then he would use a computer to invent 
ice‑cream-making machines! The computer would mix the coolest flavors and 
even sell the ice cream. There would be machines on every street corner, and 
he could get ice cream in his favorite flavor whenever he felt like it, and just as 
much as he wanted. After that, he’d build a cleaning robot and a block-sorting 
machine so that his room would always be neat and clean. Zangemann had 
great new ideas like these every day. He could think of nothing else.

As the years went by, Zangemann grew bigger and computers got smaller. In 
fact, by the time he finished school, they were so small they fit in his pocket. 
The smallest ones even fit on his fingertip.

** 7 **

## 8 ##

“Finally, I can turn all my ideas into real things!” Zangemann exclaimed, and he 
got right to work. He found ways to put the small computers into all kinds of 
things to make them even more fun and useful. And then he sold them.

Adults and children loved his inventions. All the kids 
wanted to have one of his skateboards — complete with 
the latest sounds to show off to their friends at school. 
Kids also loved his speaker invention, which could 
instantly play any song you requested. And, of course, 
everyone loved the ice cream served every afternoon from 
the automatic, extra-delicious Original Zangemann Ice 
Cream Machine. It all seemed like magic, but the secret 
was simple: the little computers that Zangemann built into 
his machines made it all possible.

** 9 **

These inventions were very popular at Ada’s school, and many of her friends rode 
around on the cool skateboards. Ada was often sad, since her mother couldn’t 
buy her any of those great things: no skateboard, no speakers, no ice cream.

Luckily, Ada lived right next to the junkyard. There were lots of broken gadgets 
and rusty parts, which she put together to make cool new things, like a soapbox 
she and Alan rode roaring down the hill, a windmill, and scary junk monsters, 
which she and Alan would fight together. She also found many useful items—an 
old cell phone, for example. The screen was cracked, but she could fix that, and 
while there wasn’t internet at the junkyard, she could get access somewhere else.

Ada had so much fun tinkering in the junkyard and fixing broken things that she 
forgot all about the skateboards and the ice cream.

## 10 ##

Because everyone bought his inventions, Zangemann soon became the richest 
person in the whole world. With all his money, he bought a huge golden 
computer with a keyboard made of jewels and set it up in the largest room 
of his mansion. From there, over the internet, he could control all the little 
computers built into his inventions.

All he had to do was press the proper key on the golden computer, and 
immediately all the ice-cream machines in town would dispense only vanilla 
ice cream. If Zangemann wanted people to eat chocolate ice cream, he pressed 
the key for chocolate ice cream. If he gave the order for lemon ice cream, the 
machines made only lemon ice cream. Zangemann loved his inventions and 
was always thrilled at how amazingly well his machines worked. Sometimes 
people were disappointed when their favorite flavor wasn’t available, but what 
could they do? After all, there was ice cream on every street corner.

** 11 **

Zangemann had a lot of fun pressing the sparkling keys and 
watching people eat ice cream. He spent many hours every 
day in front of his golden computer doing this. Again 
and again, he looked down on the city through a 
long telescope, observing how reliably his 
inventions carried out his commands.

## 12 ##

When he wasn’t sitting at his golden computer, Zangemann was building his 
little computers into new devices and then selling those. He built washing 
machines that sent a message to your cell phone when your laundry was done. 
He made vacuums that played happy music instead of droning loudly. He 
invented light bulbs that turned on and off at the snap of a finger and cars that 
told you where the nearest grocery store was.

Soon, almost every appliance in the world had a Zangemann computer built 
into it. Not all of his inventions seemed necessary at first, but people bought 
everything he made. That’s just the way it was. Everyone wanted the devices 
made by Zangemann, the greatest inventor in the world.

** 13 **

One day Zangemann thought, “Today I want to see my inventions up close.” 
He put away his big telescope, then climbed down the many stairs of 
his mansion and ventured out into the city, full of anticipation at 
the thought of enjoying his cool devices.

## 14 ##

“Maybe a little trip might even give me a few new ideas. If I’m completely honest, 
my last inventions weren’t quite as useful as the first ones... ,” Zangemann 
pondered. “But my ice-cream machines are and will remain second to none,” 
he thought immediately afterward, and not without pride, as he passed a group 
of people all eating coconut ice cream, the flavor of the day.

He was completely absorbed in his thoughts when suddenly — BAM! — something 
crashed into his shin.

** 15 **

Zangemann yelped and looked around for the cause. A startled child stood in 
front of him, holding an original Zangemann skateboard under his arm. “Sorry, 
I didn’t mean to do that,” the child stammered, but Zangemann wasn’t listening.

An angry Zangemann limped away. Suddenly, he heard loud music. He had 
never before heard something so horrible. He looked around and saw that the 
music was coming from a loudspeaker he himself had constructed. A child 
across the street was holding it. The child seemed to like the music, but it gave 
Zangemann a terrible headache, and his mood worsened. This was not how he 
had imagined his walk!

## 16 ##

Zangemann was so furious with the two children. How dare they use his 
inventions this way? That night, he couldn’t sleep, so he sat down at his golden 
computer. From there, he gave all the little computers in the skateboards a 
command that they were no longer allowed to go on sidewalks. He ordered the 
small computers in the speakers to play music only at a low volume, except for 
his favorite music, which he immediately turned on to get into a better mood.

** 17 **

## 18 ##

The next day, there was a big commotion at Ada’s school. On the way to 
school, the kids’ skateboards had stopped working. The wheels simply 
stood still. And the children could no longer turn up the volume on their 
speakers. What was going on?

** 19 **

Although she didn’t own any of these things, Ada wondered why the 
skateboards and the speakers suddenly stopped working. But she didn’t 
really have time to think much about it, because she was tinkering again. 
She put together a complete bicycle from the parts of three broken bicycles. 
She gave the bicycle to her mother as a present so that she wouldn’t have 
to spend her money on bus tickets to work. For her brother, Ada built a 
loudspeaker so he could fall asleep to nice stories in the evenings when 
their mother was still at work.

After a few days, the initial shock at Ada’s 
school was forgotten. The skateboards 
still didn’t go on the sidewalk, but 
apart from that, they still worked. 
And so now the children rode in 
circles around the playground and 
listened to soft music. Only a strange, 
pompous marching music continued 
to play at an unchanged volume, which 
the children found rather puzzling.

## 20 ##

Ada loved Wednesdays. Every Wednesday, her mother and Alan would 
pick her up from school, and they would all go to the library together. 
Ada was always drawn to the technology section. There were books 
with blueprints, instructions for experiments, and explanations of how different 
devices worked. In the library, Ada could also go online with her cell phone. She 
quickly realized that there was also much to discover on the internet. There, 
many people shared their ideas and repair tips to help others.

On one of those afternoons, Ada learned two new words: hardware and software. 
Hardware was a word for something Ada already knew: the electronic devices 
she tinkered with after school, or those devices she could hold in her hands 
and try to fix or make into something else. What was completely new to Ada 
was the word software. She soon learned that it meant instructions that ran on 
a computer to control other devices or computers. Some books called those 
instructions programs or code. With such a computer program, one could, for 
example, tell a loudspeaker which song to play and how loud.

The best thing about Ada’s new discovery was realizing that she could 
tinker with software just as she could with hardware. Hardware is built with 
tools — hammers, drills, and screws. Software is built simply by writing down 
the commands for the hardware, one after the other. There was a separate 
language for this — the programming language. With software, Ada could make 
her inventions even more useful. She really wanted to learn the programming 
language!

** 21 **

## 22 ##

Over the next few weeks, Ada spent her afternoons in the library. 
She found books and websites that explained how programming 
languages and code worked. For Ada, it felt a bit like learning a secret 
language, or like studying vocabulary in school. Ada ate it all up. She expected 
her first program to do something simple: “Make this lamp blink!”

Of course, she wanted to try her program out right away to see if it really 
worked. At the junkyard, she connected her cell phone to a small LED lamp. 
Then she typed the lines of code into her cell phone.

At first, nothing happened. Ada wondered where the error could be. She made 
a few small changes and tried again and . . . “Yeesss!” The little light began to 
flash. On, off, on, off. Ada looked at the LED in amazement. She had written her 
first program!

Ada was totally thrilled. She imagined all the great things she could do. If she 
just entered the right code, she could make her inventions do exactly what 
she wanted. It was not so easy, but after a few weeks, Ada wrote a truly useful 
program: one that would make Alan’s speakers automatically turn off half an 
hour after he had fallen asleep.

** 23 **

Ada also had an idea for the next program she would write. It was a bigger 
deal, a real project. She would probably need the whole summer break for it... 
And she could hardly wait!

## 24 ##

** 25 **

Zangemann had slept horribly every night since his terrible walk in the 
city. When he went to bed each night, worries plagued him. “Oh no, my 
marvelous inventions. It can’t be that everyone just plays around with 
them. All the things that could go wrong! I put so much thought into everything, 
down to the last detail.” Zangemann pondered and pondered and tossed and 
turned sleeplessly in his bed all night.

Waking up one morning with a deeply furrowed brow, he made a decision. He 
needed to make a change. Zangemann sat down at his computer and wrote 
one program after another. In these programs, he specified exactly what his 
inventions were to do and were not to do under any circumstances. The chaos 
had to stop!

Once he was done, he sent all the new programs from his golden computer 
to people’s devices. He ordered his speakers to play only his favorite music 
whenever he was within earshot. He programmed the ice-cream machines to 
stop selling ice cream in the afternoon. After all, he didn’t want his expensive 
clothes to get stained by ice cream while he was out for a walk. All day long he 
sat at the computer and typed and typed and typed...

## 26 ##

Summer break was already halfway over. Ada stood in front of her big 
project and scratched her head. She had built a skateboard from old parts 
and then connected a motor to make the wheels turn. With a motorized 
skateboard, Ada could zoom to the library or the junkyard even faster after 
school. Super practical! But it didn’t work. When she stood on it and pressed 
the Go! button, the wheels moved, but way too fast. Ada fell off the skateboard 
every time she started. No matter what she tried, she just couldn’t get it right.

After falling on her bottom for the hundredth time, she went back to the library. 
She always found answers to her questions there. And indeed, on the internet, 
she came across a program that someone had written for an electric scooter 
that also needed to start slowly. Ada downloaded it to her phone.

Back at the junkyard, she adapted some lines of code for her skateboard 
program. She tweaked a few things and kept tinkering.

Several failed attempts later, on the last day of summer break, the time had 
finally come. Ada stood on the skateboard and pressed the Go! button, and the 
skateboard started moving, slowly at first, then faster. It worked! She tried to 
brake. It worked! Ada let out a cry of joy and took a trip to the park.

** 27 **

## 28 ##

When Ada rode her skateboard to school on the first day back after summer 
break, the other children were amazed. During recess, Ada’s curious classmates 
surrounded her.

“How can you ride your skateboard on the sidewalk?” they asked.

** 29 **

Ada thought for a moment, then said, “I don’t think it’s your skateboards but 
actually the software in them. It’s probably programmed into the software 
that the skateboards aren’t allowed to go on the sidewalk. But that can be 
changed!”

That evening, Ada tested out her theory on her classmate Toni’s skateboard. 
She worked secretly through most of the night, and the next day, Toni could 
ride on the sidewalk again. Unfortunately, his skateboard could no longer 
make the sounds that his parents had bought from Zangemann. Instead, 
every 10 minutes it made a strange noise that sounded like a drawn-out burp. 
Ada knew that little errors like that could pop up in programs all the time. But 
Toni’s burping skateboard was really quite funny.

## 30 ##

More and more children started to visit Ada at the junkyard after school, 
and she helped them rewrite the programs in their skateboards. 
Some of her classmates were very excited about this new discovery. 
It was unbelievable what you could do with software code! They wanted to learn 
everything Ada knew about programming languages, and soon they were riding 
their skateboards again, wherever they wanted to.

But that wasn’t all. With the software, they could give their skateboards new, 
cool features. Marie attached colorful LED lights to her board that glowed 
different colors depending on the speed. Konrad built old propellers onto his 
skateboard for extra speed.

** 31 **

Ada, Toni, Marie, and Konrad spent many afternoons at the junkyard. They even 
set up a real workshop where they could fine-tune their programs for hours, 
listening all the while to music from the speakers Ada had built for Alan.

“Your brother’s speakers are much louder than ours,” remarked Toni, who was 
busy attaching a speedometer to his helmet.

“I’m sure that’s also because of the software,” Marie said.

Together, they changed the software for the speakers too. Then they turned up 
the music as loud as possible and danced wildly together.

## 32 ##

** 33 **

## 34 ##

** 35 **

Every day, Ada and her friends made plans together for the afternoon. 
From a broken ice-cream machine, they built a new one that could make 
ice cream in every imaginable shape and color. They ate square ice 
cream, heart-shaped ice cream, and even pyramid-shaped ice cream, as well 
as strawberry, raspberry, and rainbow ice cream, all with sprinkles and hot 
fudge — much better than the varieties from the Zangemann machines.

Sometimes they could even help adults. Toni reprogrammed his father’s ironing 
machine so that it could also iron ties again — Zangemann had forbidden the 
machines to do so because he hated ties like the plague. For the bus driver, 
they built an automatic watering system out of old hoses and a computer so 
that her plants would not die of thirst during summer days. And they helped the 
school custodian modify his vacuum so that it automatically recognized toys 
and wouldn’t suck them up.

Some things they built just for fun, like the fart machine they put in their math 
teacher’s chair. Whenever Ms. Gernet sat down, the machine played a little 
fart sound. The teacher would scold them, but Ada was sure that she secretly 
smirked a little every time.

## 36 ##

One day, Zangemann noticed that some computers no longer obeyed 
his programming commands. Shocked and fuming with anger, he 
called the president. In a quivering voice, Zangemann yelled, “Someone 
is rewriting the programs in my devices. That can’t happen; after all, they are my 
inventions. It’s far too dangerous if everyone can do whatever they want with the 
computers. You must make a law against this!”

The president did not want to upset Zangemann. All the government’s computers 
were programmed by Zangemann. Without the computers, the government 
would not be able to run the country. So they passed the law as Zangemann 
requested:

“All computers that do not listen to Zangemann are banned. Anyone who 
reprograms Zangemann’s devices will be fined 500,000 gold pieces!” 

** 37 **

## 38 ##

When Ada and her friends heard this, they were furious. “This is unfair,” they 
said. “We rebuilt and reprogrammed our skateboards ourselves. They are much 
better now. We won’t let anyone take that away from us!”

They gathered in front of one of their rebuilt ice-cream machines and discussed 
the situation. It was clear that something had to be done about the new law, and 
they made a plan...

** 39 **

The next day, they didn’t go to school. Instead, they rode their 
skateboards to the parliament building, with large protest signs 
under their arms, and sat down in front of the building. The evening 
before, they had put LED lights on some of the signs, which were now flashing 
brightly. They had connected their speakers together so everyone in the street 
could hear what they were saying. Some passersby stopped and asked the 
children what they were demonstrating for.

“For software freedom!” they replied in unison and told the adults their story. 
Impressed, the adults nodded, and the president also looked curiously at their 
signs as he approached the building.

On the following day, Ada and her friends again sat down in front of the 
parliament building, this time with support. Some classmates came whose 
skateboards Ada had reprogrammed. Toni’s father and other parents and 
adults also wanted to support the protest. They found the children’s devices 
very useful.

## 40 ##

With each passing day, more and more children and adults joined the protest. 
The bus driver they had helped drove up in her bus. She honked loudly to 
attract even more people to the protest. The custodian brought a few friends, 
and Toni’s father brought his colleagues from work, all wearing perfectly ironed 
ties. Even Ms. Gernet came. The crowd grew, and after a few weeks, there were 
protests not just in Ada’s city but also in many cities throughout the country.

	## BIG SIGN: "Do your homework Mr. President and we will do ours!"

** 41 **

	## TEACHER SIGN: "They are young + need the code!"

	## MEDIUM SIGN: "Don’t wreck our tech!"

## 42 ##

Ada protested in front of the parliament building every week, even in 
pouring rain. On one such rainy day, when the president passed the group 
of dripping-wet children, he couldn’t help but admire their stubbornness. 
He asked Ada, “Why do you sit here every day? What do you want to achieve?” 
Ada replied, “We want to determine for ourselves what we can and cannot do 
with our computers.” Her friends shouted in unison: “Don’t wreck our tech! 
Don’t wreck our tech!” and “We want the code! We want the code!”

The president looked at the determined faces of the children. Honestly, he, 
too, wanted to decide for himself what the government could and couldn’t do 
with its computers. But he didn’t understand anything about computers and 
code, so he had always left that to Zangemann. Deep in thought, the president 
entered the building.

The next day, the president invited Ada and her friends over. “We also want to be 
in charge of our software ourselves. In order for that to be true, the government 
must be independent from Zangemann. Can you tell me what you know about 
computer programs?” he asked them. Enthusiastically, they explained to him 
how software works and what you could do with it. The president was amazed.

** 43 **

With this new knowledge, the government would be able to design its own 
software, the way it wanted — completely without Zangemann. Immediately, the 
president called his advisers. In a large group, they discussed with the children 
everything they could change and improve in the software.

That evening, the children went home proud and satisfied. Something finally 
happened! Their long protest was worth it.

## 44 ##

The next morning, the president’s phone rang very early. It was 
Zangemann. He was angrier than ever. “Without me, the government 
computers will no longer work,” he threatened. But the president kept 
the call short and quickly hung up. The phone rang many more times that day, 
but Zangemann’s calls went unanswered. The president sat in a meeting with 
Ada, Toni, Marie, Konrad, and the government experts.

In the days that followed, they talked from morning to night and designed their 
first programs for the government’s computers. They were no longer disturbed 
by Zangemann’s calls. Toni had the good idea of reprogramming 
the telephones. When Zangemann called, he 
only heard an automated recording: “The 
government only wants to use software 
that it can freely use, study, share, and 
improve. Thank you for calling.”

Then, after many weeks of protests and 
discussions, the time had finally come: 
they abolished the old Zangemann law! 
Instead, the government announced:

** 45 **

“Everyone is allowed to program their own computers as long as they adhere to 
the other laws.”

In addition, a new school subject was introduced: computer hardware and 
software.

## 46 ##

That evening, everyone celebrated with a big party. Ada, Alan, Toni, Marie, 
Konrad, and other children from school and their parents; the president; 
Ms. Gernet; the bus driver; the custodian — they were all there. They decorated 
the streets, listened to loud music, and ate ice cream, as much as they wanted, 
and in every imaginable shape and color.

** 47 **

While the others continued partying late into the night, Ada and her friends 
slipped away to their workshop. They already had a lot of ideas for new 
inventions. And they wanted to start right away.

## 48 ##

And Zangemann? No one’s heard much from him. Maybe he’s still sitting 
angrily in front of his golden computer. Maybe he doesn’t dare go out 
into the street anymore and has boarded up all the windows of his 
mansion so that he doesn’t have to worry about what other people are doing 
with his inventions. But maybe he also sometimes looks out into the world 
through his telescope and sees what the children are inventing every day. 
Perhaps then he will remember how much fun it was for himself to tinker and 
experiment. And maybe, just maybe, he eats pyramid-shaped raspberry ice 
cream with rainbow sprinkles.

Website for the book

The Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. is a nonprofit association that 
empowers people to control technology. Software affects all areas of our life. 
That is why it is important that this technology gives us freedom instead of 
restricting us. Free Software (also called Open Source) gives everyone the 
right to use, study, share, and improve programs. Therefore, Free Software 
strengthens basic rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of the press, 
and the right to privacy.

“A rousing tale of self-reliance, community, 
and standing up to bullies... software freedom 
is human freedom!”
— Cory Doctorow, Sci-Fi Author

“Introduces readers young and old to the power 
and peril of software. Behind it all is a backdrop of 
ethics of knowledge sharing upon which the arc 
of human history rides.”
– Vin Cerf, Cumputer Scientist and 
One of the Inventors of the Internet

The inventor Zangemann is world-famous and immensely rich. Adults and 
children alike love his fabulous technical inventions. But one day there 
is a problem: the children's electronic skateboards no longer work 
properly. What’s going on? The curious girl Ada sees through what is 
going on. Together with her friends, she experiments with hardware and 
software, and the children forge a plan: Zangemann can no longer be the 
only one in control of the devices!

A book that arouses children’s interest in tinkering and encourages 
shaping technology.
