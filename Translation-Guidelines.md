# Translation guidelines

Below a few notes which we share with publishers who want to translate
the book in other languages, but we consider it also helpful for
community translations.

* Names: Ada, Zangemann, Alan must not to be changed. The other names
  are also mostly references to existing people in computer history or
  science, but if you want to change them in order to make it easier for
  children to relate to the characters we should find names which are
  still common but connected to important figures in the computer
  history. If you have problems with that, feel free to reach out to
  Matthias. Please also make sure to just exchange male names with male
  names, female names with female names to keep the gender balance
  as intended, or use names which can be male and female. 

* As the book is often used to read it out to children, we highly
  recommend to test reading it aloud, best also to a few children, to
  see if the translation works out.

* The FSFE has a dedicated translation team with volunteer proofreaders
  for many languages. They can help you as additional proofreaders to
  make sure special terms are translated correctly, or make
  recommendations.

* For the German and the English version the following parts where
  handwritten by the designer Sandra Brandstätter (if it is a latin
  language we can ask Sandra if she has time to do that for your
  language -- if you cover the costs but the Ukrainian and the Arabic
  translations found similar free fonts):
  * The title and subtitle "Ada & Zangemann - Ein Märchen über Software,
    Skateboards und Himbeereis"
  * The initials on some of the pages (we can provide them for the Latin
    alphabet)
  * On 37-38 there is the demonstration, for the English version we are
    working on we changed the text for "Ohne Code ist alles doof" and
    "Sie sind jung + brauchen den Code!" and pencilled this again. We
    recommend that your designer exchanges those with the slogans being
    used in your translation -- else you can also use the English
    version.
  * The headlines "Danksagung des Autors" + "Über den Author Matthias
    Kirschner" + "Über die Illustratorin Sandra Brandstätter" +
    "Webseite zum Buch" + "Lizenz" are handwritten. For the Ukrainian
    version they found a similar font for that. 

* For the illustrations you can change the following:
  * Page 42+43 - the left banner (two children), right button banner
    (Ada), and top right (grandma) can be translated, the others are
    more difficult and we recommend to keep them to also show that it is
    not just a protest in the local language.
  * Page 34 - "Burp" can stay, or can be changed to local language

* We would advise to keep the following English text in the
  illustrations:
  * Page 7 - richest man, can stay in EN (it is in an international magazine)
  * Page 23 - programming, can stay in EN
  * Page 44 - Ring ring, can stay    

* All fonts being used should be under a free cultural font license.
  E.g. the Open Font License so it is in line with CC-BY-SA of the book. 

* Right to Left (mirror illustrations)
  * But make sure that writing still works out (e.g. the "Z" Zangemann
    logo, or the "Ring" with the phone or "Burp" with the skateboard.

* "Z": In the war against Ukraine the Russian army is using a "Z" sign
  on military vehicles. The "Z" is quite different to the "Z"-logo of
  Zangemann, but if you do not have the "Z" in your alphabet and are
  from the war area, it could still be traumatic. That is why we decided
  for the Ukrainian version to exchange all "Z"s into the Ukrainian
  version of "Z". If you have the "Z" in your alphabet or your are not
  close to this war, you should be fine and readers will not associate
  the Zangemann logo with the war.

* It is highly appreciated if the FSFE get two copies. We can use
  pictures with the book, or also all the different language versions of
  the book for advertisement of the book. 

* You can reach out to Matthias Kirschner about promotion of the books
  in those countries, suggestions who could be good to get a quote for
  marketing, etc. 

* In the acknowledgements of the English version you can change "No
  Starch Press" to the name of your publisher, as we would like to thank
  you for publishing this book in your language under a free cultural
  license, and encourage you to do that for other books in future as
  well.
